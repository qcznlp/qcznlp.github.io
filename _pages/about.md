I am a 4th-year PhD student focusing on LLMs and computational linguistics at Northwestern University, fortunate to be advised by [Rob Voigt](https://robvoigt.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) and [Kaize Ding](https://kaize0409.github.io/).

My research focuses on **trustworthy LLMs** and **using LLMs as tools for understanding and improving society**. Recent topics include:

- **Verbalized confidence and calibration**: [arXiv 2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07264), [EMNLP 2025a](https://aclanthology.org/2025.emnlp-main.73/), [EMNLP 2025b](https://aclanthology.org/2025.emnlp-main.74/)
- **Information retrieval and search**: [arXiv 2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07264), [Findings of EACL 2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22050), [CIKM 2025](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3746252.3760818)
- **Computational social science**: [EMNLP 2024](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.872/), [EACL 2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18497), [SSRN 2025](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5259107), [Findings of AACL 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09950)

I also work on biomedical NLP, LLMs and cognitive science, and multilingual NLP.

Prior to Northwestern, I received my bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University and the University of Manchester, with a focus on linguistics and formal logic. During my undergraduate studies, I worked extensively on speech processing.
