## About
Hello! My name is Qingcheng Zeng (曾庆诚), and I also go by Steve. Currently, I am a third-year PhD student affiliated with [*Computation and Linguistic Mechanisms Lab*](https://sites.northwestern.edu/lingmechlab/) and [*Reliable, Efficient, and Autonomous Learning (REAL) Lab*](https://kaize0409.github.io/Advising.html) at Northwestern University, working with Professor [Rob Voigt](https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/robvoigt/) and Professor [Kaize Ding](https://kaize0409.github.io/) on **Large Language Models, Computational Linguistics, and Computational Social Science.**

Recently, I am mainly interested in the following research areas:
- **LLMs for Computational Social Science**
- **Trustworthy LLMs, Uncertainty Quantification, Calibration**
- **Understanding multilingual LLMs**
